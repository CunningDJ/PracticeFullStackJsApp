# Practice Full Stack TODO App
This is a practice full stack app I'm making to freshen up on different
parts of the stack.  Feel free to use it as a boilerplate.

## Backend
### NodeJS Typescript Backend
A NodeJS Express backend written in Typescript.

### Java Spring Boot Backend
A Java Spring Boot backend with the same API contract as the NodeJS backend

### Swagger
A swagger API configuration to generate Typescript and Java typing for the
front and backend

## Frontend: Typescript React App
On the frontend is a Typescript React TODO app, initialized with `create-react-app
--template typescript`. It can speak to either the Java or NodeJS server.
